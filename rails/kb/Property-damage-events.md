Basis of Settlement Adjustments
In calculating the most the Insurer will pay for any one claim, adjustments shall be made in
accordance with the following clauses.
1. Index Linking
Unless the Insured requests to the contrary, the Sums Insured and/or Declared Values will be
adjusted to take into account movements in the appropriate index and renewal premiums will be
based on the adjusted Sums Insured and/or Declared Values.
For Buildings, the General Building Cost Index issued by the Building Cost Information Service of
the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or for Residential Property the Household Rebuilding
Cost Index issued by the Association of British Insurers (or some other suitable index the Insurer
decides upon) will be used.
For Contents and other Property shown and/or described in the Schedule, the Retail Price Index
(or some other suitable index the Insurer decides upon) will be used.
The above percentage changes will continue to be applied between the date of any Damage and
the date when replacement or repair has been completed provided that the work of rebuilding or

the repair or restoration of Property damaged
any additional cost of reinstatement to comply with Public Authorities regulations, bye-laws or
stipulations
professional fees
removal of debris costs.
any items for Buildings or Contents subject to the Reinstatement (Day One Basis) clause are
declared to be separately subject to Average as described in Special Condition 2 of such clause
any other items of Property Insured (other than any Sum Insured applying solely to rent, fees,
removal of debris or private dwellings) are declared to be separately subject to Average. This
means if at the time of Damage the Sum Insured for any item is less than the value of the item
covered by such Sum Insured, the amount payable by the Insurer will be proportionately
reduced.
Subject to the Special Conditions set out below, the basis on which the amount payable, for
Buildings, Contents and any other Property for which a Declared Value is specified in the
Schedule, is to be calculated will be the reinstatement of the Property lost, destroyed or
damaged.
For this purpose "reinstatement" means
i.
ii.
in either case to a condition equivalent to, or substantially the same as, but no better or more
extensive than its condition when new.
The Declared Value (shown in brackets below the Sum Insured), having been stated in writing
by the Insured, has been used to calculate the premium.
"Declared Value" means the assessment by the Insured of the cost of reinstatement of Property
Insured arrived at in accordance with paragraph A.i. at the level of costs applying at inception of
the Period of Insurance (ignoring inflationary factors which may subsequently operate), together
with, to the extent that cover provides, due allowance for
i.
ii.
iii.
At inception of each Period of Insurance, the Insured shall notify the Insurer of the Declared
Value of Property Insured. In the absence of such declaration the last amount declared by the
Insured will be taken as the Declared Value for the new Period of Insurance, appropriately
adjusted if Index Linking applies.
If at the time of Damage the Declared Value of the Property is less than the cost of
reinstatement (as defined in paragraph A. i.) at inception of the Period of Insurance, the
amount payable by the Insurer will be proportionately reduced.
The Insurer's liability for the repair or restoration of Property damaged in part only, shall not
exceed the amount which would have been payable if such Property had been wholly destroyed.

3. Contribution and Average
If at the time of Damage any other insurance has been effected by or on behalf of the Insured
covering any of the Property Damaged, the Insurer's liability under this Section shall be limited to
the Insurer's rateable proportion of such Damage.
If such other insurance is subject to Average (Underinsurance), this Section if not already subject to
Average shall be subject to Average in like manner.
If such other insurance is subject to any provision which excludes it from ranking concurrently with
this Section, either in whole or in part, or from contributing rateably, the liability of the Insurer under
this Section shall be limited to that proportion of the Damage which the Sum Insured for this
Section bears to the value of the Property.
